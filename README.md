# Simple_Python_Game_CECS3210
Python game: The game I selected was tic tac toe. This is an early version of the code, therefore what you will see is not the final product of this game. Currently in this version one needs to click 4 times for it to draw an X on the screen. In later versions I hope to make it 1 simple click for the x to appear where the user has clicked.
